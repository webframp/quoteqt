## Nightbot Command Backup Enhancements

- [x] **Store command snapshots in database** - Save Nightbot commands locally to enable history/versioning
- [x] **Diff view** - Show comparison between saved snapshots and current Nightbot configuration
- [ ] **Track command modifications** - Investigate Nightbot API for `updatedBy` or similar field to show who last modified each command
